If you're not interested in compiling the source code and just want to use the bot on your server, here is the Discord invite code: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=454773255824211968&permissions=1010035792&scope=bot

When you compile the source you will need to create a config.properties with the node `client.token = INSERT_TOKEN`
The token being a Discord application token.

Enjoy, and if you have any bugs please use the issues section, thanks.
